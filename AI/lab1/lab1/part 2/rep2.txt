Poker Game:
Step1: In the first step i used two for loops to make a complete deck of 52 cards and then i picked six of them randomly after that i randomly 
picked 3 from 6 and gave it one player and rest 3 to other.
Step2: In step 2 i defined two functions random and fixed bidding .
Step 3: In step three i altered the analyze hand function for "Three of kind" and "High Cards" for that purpose i used each card's position in rank 
list and compared them.
Step 4: In this step i made to play a random agent vs fixed agent and in my point of view the random agent performs better due to its random values.
Step 5: In step 5 i defined a function for reflex agent and made it play againts both fixed and random agent , It takes decision according to the amount
bidded by the opponent in the previous bid and its own hand as well.
Step 6: In my observation the reflex agent performs better than the random agent.
